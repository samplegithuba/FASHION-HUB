    <p>Hey, I’m Jacob.

        Dabble really started back on a fall day in 2010. I was frustrated. I had read (or tried to read) several books that fell flat.
        
        Where were the amazing reads?? Is the world finished writing great stories?
        
        And then it hit me.
        
        I could write it! I taught myself to write software. Maybe I could do the same with fiction.
        
        That was the theory.
        
        A few minutes later, I had five new books on writing on my Kindle. I started right away with Plot & Structure by James Scott Bell. And what do you know? The introduction was titled Putting the Big Lie to Sleep and turned out to align with my theory.
        
        James shared his personal journey: took college writing classes, was told he would never be a writer by the teacher and had no writing talent. He became a lawyer. Eventually decided to come back to writing. Learned from books. Taught himself. Practiced. Became a successful thriller author. Left law. Taught others to write.
        
        That’s it! The proof I needed. I could learn to write! That’s when I became bitten by the writing bug. I devoured book after book on the writing process, plotting, editing, and dialogue. Writing turned into my second great passion, right after creating beautiful software.
        
        Over the next few years, I tried both creating my own software business and writing a novel, both on the side. I know what you’re thinking: Yeah right. And eventually, I came to that same conclusion. I couldn’t do both at once. Writing is hard! Creating a business is hard! Doing both at once in your spare time? Well, you know, live and learn.</p>
