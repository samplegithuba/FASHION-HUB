    <center>You’ve only pretended to know what organza is. When you’re shopping for yourself, you <br>
    know what you like but you don’t know how to describe it. And ninety-nine percent of <br>
     the clothing descriptions in your first draft are just “jeans.” I get it. Clothing description is <br>
     something I have to actively choose to create, too. It’s not an aspect of character design <br>
     that bubbles up naturally from the depths of my creative soul. And as a reader, nothing <br>
     bores me like an entire paragraph of detailed clothing description. <br>
    
    But I’ve also noticed that artful clothing description does make a character, a setting, and <br>
     even a moment more engaging. It’s all in the craft.It’s good that you’re here to learn how <br>
     to describe clothing in writing, because it’s a powerful tool. What your character wears <br>
     reveals where they come from, how they rank in society, how they want to be perceived, <br>
     and even how they feel about themselves.</p></center>
